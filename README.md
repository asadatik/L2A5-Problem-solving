# TypeScript Blog: Exploring any, unknown, never and Type Combinations (Union & Intersection)

## 01. Explain the difference between any, unknown, and never types in TypeScript

In TypeScript, any, unknown, and never are *special types* that help handle different levels of type safety.

### any

- The most flexible type.
- Disables type checking completely.
- Use with caution, as it can lead to runtime errors.

`ts
let data: any = "Hello";
data = 42;
data = true;

You can access any property on any, but there's no IntelliSense or error checking.

`

### unknown

Similar to any, but stricter.

You can’t use a value of type unknown unless you narrow or assert its type.

ts
let value: unknown = "TypeScript";

if (typeof value === "string") {
  console.log(value.toUpperCase());
}


This promotes safe coding practices compared to any.

### never

Represents values that never occur.

Used for:

1.  Functions that never return

2.  Exhaustive checking in switch cases

ts
function throwError(message: string): never {
  throw new Error(message);
}

function checkType(x: string | number) {
  if (typeof x === "string") {
    console.log("String");
  } else if (typeof x === "number") {
    console.log("Number");
  } else {
    const _exhaustive: never = x; // Error if a new type is added
  }
}


## 02. Using union and intersection types in TypeScript

### Union Type (|)

Union types are used when a variable can be one of multiple types.

ts
type ID = string | number;

let userId: ID;

userId = "abc123";
userId = 456;


It’s useful when a value can be more than one type but only one at a time.

### Intersection Type (&)

Intersection types combine multiple types into one. The final type will have all properties from the combined types.

ts
type Person = {
  name: string;
  age: number;
};

type Employee = {
  employeeId: number;
  department: string;
};

type EmployeeProfile = Person & Employee;

const emp: EmployeeProfile = {
  name: "Alice",
  age: 30,
  employeeId: 101,
  department: "Engineering",
};
```

This is useful for extending multiple types in a clean way

## Summary:

1.  Use any when you need flexibility (but prefer not to).

2.  Use unknown when the type is not known but should be verified.

3.  Use never when a function will never return or a type should not occur.

4.  Use Union (|) for either-or types.

5.  Use Intersection (&) to merge multiple types into one.

These tools help TypeScript developers write more expressive, reusable, and safe code.
